/**
 * The EventScript grammar pack (Phase 7.3): the full authoring reference of
 * the EventScript language `add_scene_events` accepts, with worked examples.
 * The 15-line operational core lives in the core sections (always on); this
 * full pack is degradable knowledge — it degrades to its first line under
 * context pressure, and stays reachable as the `eventscript-authoring`
 * skill. The spec test-links every example to the Phase 5 parser: each one
 * must parse, so the pack and the parser can never drift apart.

const GRAMMAR_REFERENCE = `## Structure
- One event per block. A condition line ends with a colon; the actions are the indented lines below it, one call per line.
- Indentation is significant: sub-events are indented under their parent event. Use exactly the indentation shown by read_events_source.
- Every event may carry a trailing anchor comment: \`# event-2.1\` — the id used as placement_target_event_id. Never edit the anchors; echo them back unchanged.

## Event headers (condition lines)
- \`always:\` — runs every frame (no condition).
- \`if Cond() and Cond():\` — conditions joined with \`and\`.
- \`if not Cond():\` — \`not\` inverts one condition.
- \`if Cond(1) or Cond(2):\` — \`Or(Cond(1), Cond(2))\` is the form for "or" between two conditions: \`if Or(KeyPressed("Space"), KeyPressed("Enter")) and once:\`.
- \`if Cond() and once:\` — \`once\` marks a trigger-once: the actions run one time while the conditions stay true.
- \`else:\` / \`else if Cond():\` — attach to the closest previous \`if\` at the same level.
- \`while Cond():\` — re-checks every frame while true.
- \`repeat 5 times:\` — counted loop (\`repeat 5+3 times:\` takes any expression).
- \`for each Enemy:\` — iterates the instances of an object (or group).
- \`for each child in Inventory value Key:\` — iterates the children of a structure variable/array.
- \`group "Name":\` — a group of events (shows as a foldable group in the editor).
- \`comment "text"\` — a standalone comment event (no colon, no body).
- \`link "SceneName"\` — a link event to another scene's group (no body).
- Prefix any header with \`disabled \`: \`disabled if Cond():\` — the event stays but never runs.

## Actions
- One call per indented line: \`Delete(Enemy)\`, \`Create(Player, "Player", 100, 200, "Base layer")\`, \`ResetTimer("SpawnTimer")\`.
- Prefix with \`await \` to wait for its completion before the next line: \`await Wait(1)\`.
- Variables: \`SetNumberVariable(Score, =, +1)\` (operators: =, +, -, *, /), \`SetSceneNumberVariable(...)\`, \`SetGlobalNumberVariable(...)\`.

## Values, strings and escaping
- Numbers are plain (250, -3.5, 2 * TimeDelta()). Strings are double-quoted: "Hello".
- Inside a string, escape double quotes with a backslash: "He said \\"hi\\"" — same for backslashes.
- Expressions are usable in any number or string parameter: \`SetX(Player, GetX(Player) + 250 * TimeDelta())\`.
- Object parameters take an object or group name: Player, "Enemies".

## Placement (how add_scene_events targets the scene)
- One batch = one object with: event_script, placement_relation, placement_target_event_id, expected_event_source.
- placement_relation: insert_at_end | insert_at_beginning | insert_before_event | insert_after_event | insert_as_sub_event | insert_and_replace_event | replace_entire_event_and_sub_events | delete_event.
- For the replace relations, echo the target's current source (from read_events_source) in expected_event_source: the edit is refused when the target changed since you read it.
- Sub-events deeper than what read_events_source shows are collapsed as \`# ...\` markers: to edit them, target their nearest visible parent.

## What does not fit EventScript
- JavaScript code events are not authored in EventScript: use the run_script tool to run JavaScript (it can call the other tools), or ask the user to add a JS code event by hand.`;
