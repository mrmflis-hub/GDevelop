 * The JS API pack (Phase 7.5): what JavaScript can touch in GDevelop, for

 * events" warning and keeps the deep signatures in the js-custom-rendering
 * skill.

const JS_API_CORE = `- Prefer events. Reach for JavaScript only when events are clearly worse (complex data transforms, procedural content, per-frame math over many instances). Renderer internals are version-dependent: code that touches them can break with an engine update.
- In a JS code event, the scope gives you: \`runtimeScene\` (the gdjs.RuntimeScene), \`objects\` (the object lists of the event, as arrays of RuntimeObject), and the global \`gdjs\`.
- In an extension function (event function or behavior): \`eventsFunctionContext.getObjects("ObjectName")\` returns the object lists, \`eventsFunctionContext.getArgument("ArgName")\` the arguments; a behavior function has \`this.owner\` (the object it is attached to).
- The engine helpers live under \`gdjs.evtTools\`: common, string, object, camera, input, sound, storage, variable, window, network — the same implementations the built-in actions call.
- Renderer access (at your own risk): \`object.getRendererObject()\` is the PixiJS display object of an object instance, \`object.get3DRendererObject()\` the three.js one for 3D objects, and \`runtimeScene.getLayer("UI").getRenderer().getThreeScene()\` the three.js scene of a 3D layer.
- Full signatures: the bundled TypeDoc reference of the runtime (see the docs tools), and search_reference for the expression/action equivalents.
- Docs: [docs: events/js-code/index.md] covers JS code events — search_docs and read_doc can fetch it offline.`;
